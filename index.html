OVERSIGHT APP PRIVACY POLICY (Rune Digital Studio)
Effective Date: November 20, 2025
Rune Digital Studio operates the Oversight mobile application (the “Service”). Oversight is a local security auditing tool. We are committed to protecting user privacy by ensuring no sensitive data leaves the device.
1. DATA COLLECTION AND SYSTEM ACCESS (CRITICAL DISCLOSURE)
1.1 Data Collection: The Oversight application DOES NOT collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information (PII). This includes user names, email addresses, or usage patterns.
1.2 Sensitive System Access (Package Auditing): The primary function of Oversight is to audit the security profile of other applications installed on your device. To do this, the application utilizes the Android operating system’s permissions to retrieve the full list of installed packages and their requested permissions.
•	Data Accessed: List of installed packages and their declared permissions (e.g., whether App X requests CAMERA access).
•	Purpose: Exclusively for local security auditing and display to the user.
•	Data Retention: All audit data is processed only on the user’s device and is discarded upon closing the app.
2. AUDITED PERMISSIONS (HIGH-RISK CATEGORIES)
Oversight specifically analyzes apps requesting these sensitive permissions to identify potential threats:
•	CAMERA (Microphone)
•	RECORD_AUDIO (Microphone)
•	ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
•	READ_CONTACTS
•	READ_SMS
•	READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
3. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY
•	Storage Location: All processing, analysis, and results are executed and stored on your device only.
•	External Transmission: NO DATA IS EVER SENT OFF THE DEVICE. We do not use external servers, databases, or analytics services that store personal data.
